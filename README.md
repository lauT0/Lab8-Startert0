### Graceful degradation and service workers relation:  

Graceful degradation is starting with lots of technology and afterwards adding lower level functionality. When or application depends on having to access information from the internet, we start with always fetching data from the internet. This is the high level starting point. Then we can integrate service workers in our software so that we don't always need to access information from the internet, instead, saving it on the cache. This process follows graceful degradation because we have add lower level functionality with service workers after the high level functionality.
